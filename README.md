# Loan_Data-Analysis
This project aims to use historical data of loans to build a model with different classification algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

This project will use k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine &amp; Logistic Regression to explore which algorithm gives the best accuracy. The data set includes details of customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.
